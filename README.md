# Design-Optimization
Different  optimisation techniques which can be added to a application to improve the performance of a application.

1. Caching : Caching is the process of temporarily storing the data at a certain location, such that you can use the data multiple times without directly reading from the databases, and thus enhancing the applicationâ€™s performance. Caching helps to reduce the number of calls that are made to the database.

The data that is constantly changing is not a good candidate for caching, whereas the data that does not change very frequently is a good candidate for caching.
